keyboardnav-extended
====================

A Zenphoto plugin for keyboard navigation using the left/right arrows for gallery/album pages, single image pages,news index/categories and single news articles pages. On single image pages the up arrow key also takes back to the album.

##Usage:##
 - Place the plugin file within `/plugins` and enable it
 -  Set the option for which pages you wish to enable the keyboard navigation
 - The plugin attaches to your theme automatically

*Note:* This only works correctly with themes following the standard theme structure. 

Inspired by Laurent Marineau's plugin http://www.zenphoto.org/news/keyboard-plugin though no adaption.
